                        Information Technology is a growing market in most industries, and this calls for more jobs and advancement opportunities. Unlike Computer Science, in IT the race to the finish line is clearer as in this time, there are fewer professionals in the field. In college, to obtain an IT degree, course load is comparatively lesser and more substantiated than that of Computer Science which has a more complex and a broader spectrum of topics to cover.
