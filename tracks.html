                                        <h3>Business Intelligence Track</h3>
                                        <p>Business Intelligence (BI) is the technology that companies such as Amazon.com and Google use to take advantage of the enormous amount of data they collect and analyze. It is the technology with which Amazon.com knows what book to recommend you every time you login, Google knows how to rank the pages you are searching for, and banks decide whether to approve loan applications almost instantly. As organizations increasingly have to deal with â€œbig data," the number of job openings and the need for skilled professionals in this field will continue to increase.</p>

                                        <h3>Computer Forensics Track</h3>
                                        <p>Computer Forensics (CF) is a discipline of forensic science that combines elements of law and information technology to collect and analyze data from computer systems, networks, wireless communications, and storage devices in a way that is admissible as evidence in a court of law. CF is also the process of using scientific knowledge for collecting, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence to the courts. With the increasing use of computers to commit crimes and growing demand for computer-based data in civil proceedings, a need has rapidly developed for forensic experts to extract useful information from computer evidence.</p>

                                        <h3>Information Architecture Track</h3>
                                        <p>Information Architecture (IA) is the discipline of designing and implementing information systems that support and enable business strategies and operations. The information architecture track addresses topics covering concepts such as usability (including accessibility, experience design, interaction design, and user interface design), information design (including information find ability and content management), component-based design (including web services, services oriented architecture, process oriented architecture, and cloud computing), and enterprise systems. As organizations are relying on increasingly more complex information systems to compete and survive, they are in dire need of IT professionals who understand how to design, deploy, and manage an efficient IT architecture to support their information systems.</p>

                                        <h3>System Administration Track</h3>
                                        <p>System Administration (SA) focuses on the deployment and maintenance of computer systems and networks. The system administration track concerns issues related to the selection, installation, configuration and maintenance of Linux- and Windows-based systems (including shell programming and scripting, heterogeneous systems, remote management, the legal issues of system administration, as well as the design and implementation of policies and automated administration regimes) and Internet-working environments. As organizations keep investing in their information systems, talents are needed to help design, deploy, manage, and safeguard these systems.</p>
